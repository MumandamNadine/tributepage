                <p> On 26 April 2004, Fassie was rushed to a Johannesburg hospital with cardiac arrest.Although doctors
                    resuscitated her, she slipped into a coma. For two weeks, fans all over the country held prayer
                    services and supported her, her friends and family.<br> On 9 May she died. At first, it was believed
                    that the heart failure was a result of an asthma attack. But after her death, new evidence came to
                    light, according to which Fassie's heart failure was caused by a drug overdose. <br>Furthermore, it
                    is believed that the crack cocaine which she had smoked the night before her cardiac arrest was
                    laced with rat poison.
                    Her funeral was held on 23 May in her hometown, Langa. She left behind a 19-year-old son, Bongani
                    Fassie.</p>
